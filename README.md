Basic coding examples
- [x] combine_csv.py combines multiple csv files into one without repeating the header. Use from terminal: python3 combine.csv.py [file folder] [output_file_name.csv] [encoding optional] [delimiter optional]<br>
Note: This has the delimiter currently set to '|' (pipe) on the output as the files I was combining were from Zotero and used commas to separate authors.
